1. Introduction
   ------------

   This program was written to perform the fitting for the
   new CDF Run I B exclusive lifetime analysis.
   It performs simultaneous fitting of mass and lifetime
   distributions of a single data sample or does a combined fit
   of several data samples where the background distributions
   are treated separately and the only common fit parameters are
   basically the average lifetime and mass.
   bexclfit is written in C++/ROOT. It does not read HBOOK ntuple
   or ROOT trees directly. Those files have to be converted to 'BDecay'
   files using the program 'mkbdecay'. It might be necessary to
   change the mkbdecay program for your own ntuple or ROOT files.
