If you want to use libconf in a c++ program include the header
file this way:

extern "C" {
#include "libconf.h"
}   


To build the library type 'make'.
This will create the library 'libconf.a' and an example program 'conf_example'.
The example program parses the example config file 'example.conf'.


The size of the config file to be read is limited to 500 lines with
a maximum of 100 characters each.
